        <p>Engineers' Day is celebrated on September 15th in India to honor Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, a prominent engineer. He played a key role in India's infrastructure and industry development, and served as the Diwan of Mysore.Engineers play a vital role in our society. They design and build the infrastructure that we rely on, from roads and bridges to buildings and machines. They also develop new technologies that improve our lives, such as medical devices, energy-efficient appliances, and communication systems.
 Engineers are essential to the development of our world. They help us to solve problems, improve our lives, and create a better future.Engineers' Day is a day to celebrate the Achievements of Engineers.</p>

    <div class="Who">
        <h2 style="color: white; background-color: brown; display: inline; border-radius: 5px;">Who was Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya?</h2>
        <p>On Engineer's Day, the nation pays tribute to Visvesvaraya for his contributions to the society. Born in Karnataka in 1861, Visvesvaraya studied Bachelor of Arts(BA) from the University of Mysore and then studied civil engineering from the College of Science in Pune and went on to become one of the most eminent engineers in the country.

            Visvesvaraya started his career as an assistant engineer in the Public Works Department of the Government of Bombay and made significant contributions to many technical projects in Mysore, Hyderabad, Odisha and Maharashtra. He was appointed as the Diwan of Mysore in 1912 and as a chief engineer, he constructed the famous Krishna Raja Sagara Dam in the city.</p>

        <p>South African-born Canadian engineer, businessman, and inventor Elon Musk formerly co-founded Paypal and is the current co-founder, and CEO of Tesla, the co-founder of SpaceX, The Boring Company, and SolarCity, as well as the co-founder of Neuralink. Love him or hate him, his achievements are impressive and certainly qualify him to be included in our list of greatest engineers.
               The potential of his ambitious projects, if achieved, will be very important for the future. While some would consider him more of a businessman than an engineer per se, his drive to innovate and develop new technologies has earned him his place in history

    <p>Since we've mentioned George Westinghouse and Tesla, we would be negligent not to mention Thomas Alva Edison. He was an American inventor and businessman who has been described as America's greatest inventor.
        Edison developed many devices that have influenced life all over the world. These include the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb.</p>

        <p>Not content with being a great artist, Da Vinci turned his hand to architecture, science, music, maths, engineering, and more. His discoveries and inventions at the time were unfathomable to his contemporaries. Many of his inventions were never actually realized but have always been preserved in his surviving journals. However, one of these, the hang glider, was practically developed in his time. 
            His other inventions included flying machines, armored vehicles, concentrated solar power, the adding machine, and a double hull. Most were alien concepts at the time but are common practice today. Although he is not as accomplished as many other engineers, his ingenuity and creativity make him one of the most popular technical and artistic minds.</p>

            <h3 style="color: black; background-color: green; display: inline; border-radius: 5px;">Nikola Tesla</h3>
            <p>Mr. Tesla's achievements are without doubt. This Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, and physicist had to be included on our list. Tesla's prolific technical mind helped him further many technologies in his day -- much to our benefit. He spent some of his life working for Thomas Edison, who is widely criticized for stealing many of his subordinate's inventions and claiming credit for himself. Whether true or not, Tesla soon fell out with Edison and left his company to pursue his interests.
                His contributions to the design of modern A.C. electrical supplies have enormously impacted humanity. Tesla also significantly contributed to modern radio, X-rays, and the induction motor. Personally, Tesla was very quirky. This often meant that many of his coworkers and peers considered him to be a little crazy and obsessive. Despite all this, Tesla's achievements have done more for modern society than many other engineers ever.</p>

                <p>First and foremost, we present the great Archimedes. Universally recognized as the greatest of all classical engineers, he has influenced the fields of mathematics, physics, engineering, and astronomy for millennia.
                    Little is known about the details of his life, but his discoveries and inventions are still well-known today. From his screw pump to compound pulley systems and defensive mechanisms for his home island of Syracuse, Archimedes is genuinely one of the greatest engineers.</p>

                <p>Visvesvaraya began his career by working for the Government of British India, working in Bombay Presidency and other British-held colonies in the Middle East. He later worked for Hyderabad State. After retirement, he began his administrative and statesmanship career and continued his engineering career in the Kingdom of Mysore.Visvesvaraya National Memorial Trust manages a memorial for Visvesvaraya at his birthplace of Muddenahalli. The memorial exhibits his awards, titles and personal belongings, including his living room, spectacles, cups, books and block with which his visiting cards were printed. Models of the Krishna Raja Sagar Dam, which Visvesvaraya designed and supervised the construction of, are exhibited. The memorial is adjacent to his house, which was refurbished and is regarded as a shrine by locals.</p>

The memorial exhibits his awards, titles and personal belongings, including his living room, spectacles, cups, books and block with which his visiting cards were printed. Models of the Krishna Raja Sagar Dam, which Visvesvaraya designed Visvesvaraya became an assistant engineer in 1885 at the Public Works Department, Bombay, in Bombay Presidency.
                    In 1899, Visvesvaraya was invited to join the Indian Irrigation Commission where he implemented an intricate system of irrigation in the Deccan Plateau and designed and patented a system of automatic weir water floodgates that were first installed in 1903 at Khadakvasla Dam near Pune. These gates raised the storage level in the reservoir to the highest level likely to be attained without causing any damage to the dam. Based on the success of these gates, the same system was installed at Tigra Dam in Gwalior and later at the KRS Dam at Mysore, Karnataka. He later became the chief engineer of the Laxmi Talav Dam near Kolhapur.
                    
                    In around 1906/1907, the Government of British India sent Visvesvaraya to the British Colony of Aden (present-day Yemen), to study water supply and drainage systems. The project prepared by him was successfully implemented in Aden.[15] </p>
